```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I am learning to use Git and Github for version control on an RStudio project. I am modifying this file, staging and committing changes, and then pushing to Github.

I will be creating a plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph).

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance(miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below.

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
